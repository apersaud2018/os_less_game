# Welcome to an OS-less game

Hello! This is a small game written in x86 assembly that is meant to be run in the Bochs virtual machine.

# Theory
For an indepth look at the exact function of the code, please look at the [About.pdf](./About.pdf).


# Running

To run this game you will need [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [Nasm](https://www.nasm.us/), and [Bochs](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bochs/files/bochs/).
This assumes that all three executables are now on your PATH.
In the main folder(the folder where make.py exists) run `python make.py build` (`python3` if on Linux). This will compile the boot loader and main program and write them to a flat binary image file. Afterwards, if on Windows you can run the game with Bochs by double clicking on the rungame.bxrc. On Linux you use the command `bochs -qf rungame.bxrc` . This starts Bochs with all the configurations needed for it to run the game. There is a good chance it will start with the debugger running. This functions much like the gdb debugger, so type c to continue.
On the main menu the game will start if you press **enter**. You use **space** to jump.
